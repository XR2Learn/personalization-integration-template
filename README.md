# XR2Learn Unity App Personalization Integration Template (Integration between Personalization Enablers and Unity Applications)

This is an example app of how to communicate a Unity Application with Personalization Enablers.
Personalization Enablers and Unity application to communicate by exchanging messages using Pub/Sub protocol.

Redis is used as a message broker for the message exchange. Thus, this example includes:

- Code to connect to Redis in Unity,
- Code to create a publisher and a subscriber in Unity
- Code with the sending and receiving message formats to communicate with the Personalization Enablers.

This example app includes a simple graphic interface as depicted below.

## Installing Redis Lib

### Installing NuGets in Unity

*[Docs on installation](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity?tab=readme-ov-file#unity-20193-or-newer)*

### Overview install instructions:

In the project, go to `Window->Package Manager->[+]->Add Package From git URL`.

and paste the url for the NuGetForUnity: `https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity.git?path=/src/NuGetForUnity`

### Install NRedisStack NuGets

Go to `NuGet For Unity->Online (tab)` and search for `NRedisStack`. Select this package and click
in `Install All Selected`.

## Redis Connection

The `UIExample.cs` script contains a script with a simple example of how to connect with Redis as both a publisher and
subscriber and how to translate the Redis messages into Unity internal variables.

### Important Point

Running complex unity code in the method used for handling the subscribed Redis messages can be complicated to debug in
Unity (i.e. `ProcessMessageNextActivityLevel` in the `UIExample.cs`). It is best for the methods that handle the
subscribed messages to only update primitive variables and have the `update` or other standard Unity method update more
complex components based on the primitive variables just populated.

## Running the App

- Set the Redis connection string to the `ip:port` where the Redis instance is running.

- Then click on `Connect`.
- Select `User Level` and `Activity Level`
- Click on `Start Activity` to publish the message that will start an activity
- Click on `Stop activity` to publish the message that will stop the current activity
- You will be able to see the Next suggested activity level on the Dropdown to the right.
- Clicking on `Disconnect` will end the connection to the Redis instance.

## Builds

We are making available a compiled build that you can download and run to see this example functionalities.

## Message Formats
####  Unity as publisher:

**Channel**: `start_activity`

**Message**: 
    `{
        'id': id_activity, 
        'user_level': user_level,
        'activity_level': activity_level
    }`

---

**Channel**: `stop_activity`

**Message**: 
    `{
        'id': 0,
        'timestamp': Date.now()
        }`

---
#### Unity as subscriber:

**Channel**: `next_activity_level`

**Message**: 
      `{
        'id': id_previous_activity,
        'next_activity_level': next_activity_level (int values, 0, 1 or 2)
        }`
